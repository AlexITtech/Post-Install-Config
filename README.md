1.) With osTicket now successfully set up on our virtual machine, the next step is to configure administrative settings within the system. We'll start by defining roles in the help desk, which will allow us to efficiently manage user access and permissions.

3.) Next, enter a name for the new roleâ€”for example, Supreme Admin. This role will define the responsibilities and access levels assigned to users. Since we're creating a Supreme Admin role, we'll enable all available permissions to grant full administrative privileges.
